<h2>Description</h2>

<p>These no-fuss "donuts" transform fluffy, buttery Hawaiian rolls into a cozy, autumn-inspired treat. Each roll is baked to a perfect golden-brown, with a warm apple pie filling hidden inside.</p>
<p>After baking, they are brushed with melted butter and generously rolled in a sweet, spiced apple cider and cinnamon-sugar coating.</p>
<p>The result is a simple dessert with the irresistible flavors of a classic apple cider donut, delivering a soft, sweet dough, a burst of warm apple filling, and a delightfully sugary, spiced crust</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>

<li>1 (12-count) package Hawaiian rolls</li>
<li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>
<li>2 (0.74 ounce) pouches apple cider powdered drink mix (such as Alpine Spiced Apple CiderÂ®)</li>
<li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>

<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
<li>Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.</li>
<li>Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet apple cider mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.</li>
<li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.</li>
<li>Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar mixture.</li>
