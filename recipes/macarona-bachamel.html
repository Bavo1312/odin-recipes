<h2>Description</h2>

<p><strong>Macarona Bechamel</strong> is a classic Egyptian pasta bake layered with savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and penne pasta baked to golden, bubbly perfection. This classic Middle Eastern comfort food is rich, hearty, and always a favorite in my home. Think lasagna vibes, but with a uniquely Egyptian twist!</p>

<p>Personally this migt be my favorite Egyptian food, when i was a kid, when i came back from school and found Macarona Bachamel, it was like the best thing ever. Whenever there is a family gathering, there's going to be macarona bachamel there no doubt</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>

<li>Penne pasta</li>
<li>Ground beef</li>
<li>Onion</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Tomato sauce</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>spices</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<h3>1.Prepare the meat</h3>

<ol>

<li>Sauté a diced onion in oil until softened.</li>
<li>Add ground beef to the pan, breaking it up as you cook until it is no longer pink.</li>
<li>Add minced garlic and your chosen spices.</li>
<li>Mix in tomato paste or sauce and simmer for several minutes to combine the flavors.</li>

</ol>

<h3>2.Make the bachamel sauce</h3>

<ol>

<li>In a separate pot, melt butter over medium-low heat.</li>
<li>Whisk in flour and cook for 1 to 2 minutes to create a roux, a paste that serves as the sauce's thickener.</li>
<li>Gradually pour in milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps. Chicken broth can also be added for extra flavor.</li>
<li>Continue to whisk and cook the sauce over medium heat until it has thickened to your desired consistency.</li>
<li>Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>

</ol>

<h3>3. Assemble and bake the dish</h3>

<ol>

<li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
<li>Cook your preferred pasta (penne is traditional) until it is al dente, as it will continue to cook in the oven.</li>
<li>Mix some of the béchamel sauce into the cooked pasta.</li>
<li>Spread a thin layer of béchamel on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
<li>Add half of the pasta to the dish, followed by an even layer of the meat filling.</li>
<li>Cover the meat with the remaining pasta.</li>
<li>Pour the rest of the béchamel sauce over the top, making sure it is completely covered.</li>
<li>Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
<li>Allow the casserole to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before serving so it sets properly. </li>

</ol>
